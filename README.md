# library

This is a library app made for The Odin Project. Users can add books, change their read status, and remove them from their bookshelf.

Creating this solidified my knowledge of:
- object constructors
- iterating over arrays
- DOM manipulation
- how to create a table using Javascript
- CSS styling
